# Getting started with R

This session, we will focus on statistical testing with R. 

We will learn how to:

* conduct *t*-tests
* conduct chi-square tests
* Interpret the results of such tests.

We will be using the `epiDisplay` library to do these calculations.

To read more about the `epiDisplay` library, see [here](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/epiDisplay/versions/3.5.0.1).

## Before we start
Cot death was an important problem in the 1980s and New Zealand experienced an epidemic of the disease. There was a competition between the lab scientists and epidemiologists over who would be able to come up with an answer to respond to the epidemic.

The critical elements of a case-control study are the definition of cases and controls (the disease), and the potential exposures.

Here, **cases** were mothers of babies who had a child that died from unexplained causes in the first year of life, whereas **controls** were mothers of children less than one year old who were in normal health.

Some of the possible **causes** or **exposures** were:

* sleeping position (front vs. back or side)
* bedsharing (yes or no)
* maternal smoking (yes or no)

## Loading libraries

Two libraries that will help us achieve our goals today will be:
 
```{r eval = FALSE}
magrittr
```
which allows us to use the pipe operator (`%>%` ) in R. Also,

```{r eval = FALSE}
lattice
```
is useful for making plots.

To install and load libraries in R we use the following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require(rio)) install.packages("rio"); library(rio)
## Note: 'library(rio)' means you don't have to always call
## rio::import(etc...), you can instead write only 'import(etc...)'
## R will now be able to 'look' for functions in the 'rio' library

## Exercise
## Write some code to install the epiDisplay, magrittr and lattice packages

```

## Import our data

We will import some data from the internet. It is a cot-death dataset. We will talk about what it means later, but for now will just dive in to have a look at the data. It was a *case-control* study to look for risk factors for cot-death in the 1980s.

We will use the following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
df <- rio::import("https://flexiblelearning.auckland.ac.nz/data-analysis/menu/1/files/simple_sids_epiinfo2.xlsx")
```
This effectively takes our Excel sheet from the web and pulls it into our computer. The `<-` is an assignment operator which names our new spreadsheet `df`. I've chosen the name `df` because the technical word for a spreadsheet in `R` is a `data.frame`.


## *t*-tests: do cases and controls have different birth weights?

We want to know whether birth weight is likely to influence risk of cot-death.

To do this we compare the means of the birth weights between the cases and the
controls. Let's first examine the distribution of birth weight with the following code...
```{r eval = FALSE}


lattice::histogram(~ Birth_wt, data = df)

```
What does the distribution look like? Why is this important?

Now let's compare the distribution of `Birth_wt` by `Case_status`.

Here, the vertical line `|` means "*given*" or "*by*". Thus, the formula is saying plot 
`Birth_wt` by `Case_status`

```{r eval = FALSE}

lattice::histogram(~ Birth_wt | Case_status, data = df)

```
To make it easier to appreciate the difference we are trying to see, let's try
and refine the plot a little bit.

```{r eval = FALSE}

lattice::histogram( ~ Birth_wt | Case_status, data = df[, c("Birth_wt", "Case_status")] %>% na.omit,
                    layout = c(1, 2),
     xlab = "birth weight (grams)",
    panel = function(x, ...) {
      panel.histogram(x, ...)
     panel.abline(v = mean(x, na.omit = TRUE), col = 'black', lty = 2 , lwd = 3)
         } )

```
To plot the medians, we would have to change the following line of code

`panel.abline(v = quantile(x, 0.5), col = 'black', lty = 2 , lwd = 3)`

Note: here, the `layout = c(1, 2)` argument is stacking the plots on top of each other.

The `xlab` argument is changing the x-axis label, and the function is drawing 
a line at the median of each of the two distributions.

What we are asking in the *t*-test is whether the difference in means is likely to be systematically different between the cases and controls.

From the plot, what is your immediate conclusion?

Also, observe the differences in the distributions of `Birth_wt` by `Case_status`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
lattice::bwplot( ~ Birth_wt | Case_status, data = df, 
                 layout = c(1, 2), # columns first, rows second.
                 xlab = "Birth weight (grams)") # modify x-axis label.
```

To check whether or not this difference is due to chance (the *null hypothesis*), we need to do a 
*t*-test.

The `t.test(y ~ x)` function in R is used where `y` is numeric and `x` is binary.

```{r eval = FALSE}
t.test(Birth_wt ~ Case_status, data = df)

```

`2.2e-16` is **scientific notation** which is the same as $2.2 \text{ x } 10^{-16}$ or 0.00000000000000022. This is a very small number, which means that if there were truly no difference in birth weight between the two groups, it would be extremely rare to see such a difference, if the study were repeated over and over. In fact, it would be expected to get such a result of more extreme less than 1 in **one hundred trillion** repetitions!

As a bit of revision, we will remind ourselves of what the *t*-test means.

The _t_ statistic estimates how many standard errors the observed results are from the null value of no difference. 

The formula for the _t_ statistic is:
\begin{align}
        t  &= \frac{\text{difference in means}}{\text{standard error of difference in means}} \\
           &= \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\text{standard error of difference in means}} \\
           &= \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\
\text{Where:}\\
\sigma &= \text{the standard deviation of the sample, in groups 1 and 2} \\
n &= \text{the total number of measurements taken in groups 1 and 2} \\
\bar{x} &= \text{the mean of groups 1 and 2} \\
\end{align}

The critical threshold for the _t_ statistic varies according to the degrees of freedom which is $n_1$ + $n_2$ - 2.

We can visualise this distribution with the following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- seq(-10, 10, length = 100)
dfreedom = 491
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l", lty = 2, xlab = "t-value (standard errors from the mean)", 
     ylab = "Density", 
     main = "Comparison of t-distributions", col = "blue", lwd = 1.5)
    lines(x, dt(x, dfreedom), col  = "red")
    abline(v = c(-9.4866, 9.4866), col = "dark green", lwd = 1.5)
```

This is quite complicated, but the main issue is seeing the resulting plot.

A non-parametric alternative which may be useful if you are concerned about the symmetry or normality assumptions of the distribution is the Wilcoxon Rank sum test (also known as the Mann-Whitney test). This is as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
wilcox.test(Birth_wt ~ Case_status, data = df)
```
Compare the two results. Are they in the same ballpark?

How would you explain the results of this test to a colleague?

## Homework

What could be a possible biological explanation?

What might be possible known causes of low birth weight?

Possibilities here are: cigarette smoking and gestational age.

Could we investigate this further in the data?

Test to see whether or not there is a difference in `Birth_wt` by smoking status (`Mother_smoke`).

Check whether gestational age (`Gestation`) differs by `Case_status`.

Make both the plots and the statistical tests. Interpret both the plots and the tests.

Do these results support our hypothesis, that these factors may mediate
the relationship between birth weight and case status?
